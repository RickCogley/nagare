# Programming Paradigm Analysis: Nagare

## Overview

Nagare is **primarily object-oriented** with functional programming elements mixed in. This hybrid approach is typical
of modern TypeScript applications.

## Object-Oriented Characteristics

### 1. Class-Based Architecture

The codebase heavily uses classes for all major components:

- `ReleaseManager` - Orchestrates the release process
- `GitOperations` - Handles Git interactions
- `TemplateProcessor` - Manages template rendering
- `ChangelogGenerator` - Creates changelogs
- `FileHandlerManager` - Manages file updates

### 2. Encapsulation

Each class encapsulates its own state and behavior:

```typescript
class ReleaseManager {
  private config: NagareConfig;
  private git: GitOperations;
  private logger: Logger;
  // Methods operate on encapsulated state
}
```

### 3. Dependency Injection

Classes receive dependencies through constructors rather than creating them internally, promoting loose coupling and
testability.

## Functional Programming Elements

### 1. Pure Utility Functions

Several modules export pure functions without side effects:

- `isDangerousPattern()` - Validates regex patterns
- `getRecommendedSafePattern()` - Suggests safe patterns
- `validateGitRef()` - Validates git references

### 2. Immutable Data

- Extensive use of `as const` assertions
- Configuration objects are treated as immutable
- Type definitions emphasize data immutability

### 3. Functional Array Methods

The code uses functional approaches for data transformation:

```typescript
const hasBreaking = commits.some((c) => c.breakingChange);
const types = commits.map((c) => c.type);
```

## Why Not Pure OOP?

TypeScript (and JavaScript) are inherently **multi-paradigm** languages:

1. **First-class functions** - Functions are values that can be passed around
2. **Prototype-based inheritance** - Different from classical OOP
3. **Closures and higher-order functions** - Fundamental language features
4. **No true private members** (until recent additions) - Encapsulation was convention-based

## Conclusion

Nagare follows a **pragmatic hybrid approach**:

- **Object-oriented design** for structure and organization
- **Functional programming** for data transformation and utilities
- **Type-driven development** leveraging TypeScript's type system

This combination provides:

- Clear architectural boundaries (OOP)
- Predictable, testable functions (FP)
- Type safety throughout (TypeScript)

The result is maintainable, well-structured code that leverages the best of both paradigms.
