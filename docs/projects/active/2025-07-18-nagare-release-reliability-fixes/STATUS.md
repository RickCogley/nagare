- ‚úÖ Visual timeline rendering issue (completed)

### Progress Update
- **‚úÖ Phase 1 Complete**: Pre-commit rollback system implemented and tested
- **‚úÖ Phase 2 Complete**: JSR verification improvements with API integration
- **‚úÖ Phase 3 Complete**: Visual timeline fixes with terminal compatibility
- **‚úÖ Phase 4 Complete**: Integration, testing, and polish completed
- **‚úÖ Phase 5 Complete**: Dynamic branch detection to replace hardcoded "main" references
- **‚úÖ Phase 6 Complete**: JSR import constraint fixes and successful v2.10.0 release

## Key Findings Summary

### ‚úÖ Rollback Issue (COMPLETED)
- **Root cause**: Files modified before validation, no pre-commit cleanup
- **Impact**: Leaves working directory in inconsistent state on failure
- **Solution implemented**: BackupManager with pre-modification backup and automatic restoration
- **Technical details**: 
  - Integrated BackupManager into ReleaseManager
  - Files backed up before modification in vulnerability window (lines 582-647)
  - Automatic restoration on release failures
  - Comprehensive testing completed successfully

### ‚úÖ JSR Verification Issue (COMPLETED)
- **Root cause**: Race condition between workflow success and JSR availability
- **Impact**: False failures despite successful publishing
- **Solution implemented**: JSR REST API integration with grace periods and proper version checking
- **Technical details**:
  - Switched from HEAD requests to official JSR REST API endpoints
  - Added 45-second grace period for JSR processing after GitHub Actions complete
  - Improved version checking using both latest version and versions endpoint
  - Enhanced error handling and debugging information
  - **Verified with nagare**: Uses `GET https://jsr.io/api/scopes/rick/packages/nagare` (very fast response)

### ‚úÖ Visual Timeline Issue (COMPLETED)
- **Root cause**: ANSI escape sequences not supported in non-TTY environments
- **Impact**: Broken progress display during releases, especially in CI/CD
- **Solution implemented**: Terminal compatibility detection with graceful degradation
- **Technical details**:
  - Added TTY detection and ANSI capability checking
  - Implemented simple append-only output for non-TTY environments
  - Auto-fallback from detailed to minimal style when needed
  - Added debug mode for troubleshooting (NAGARE_DEBUG=true)
  - Improved error handling for environment variable access

### ‚úÖ Hardcoded Branch References (COMPLETED)
- **Root cause**: Hardcoded "main" branch references throughout codebase
- **Impact**: Incompatibility with repositories using different default branches
- **Solution implemented**: Dynamic branch detection using `git branch --show-current`
- **Technical details**:
  - Added getCurrentBranch() method to GitOperations class
  - Updated ReleaseManager to use dynamic branch detection
  - Fixed ReleaseStateTracker branch references in git push operations
  - Fallback to "main" if branch detection fails for backward compatibility

### ‚úÖ JSR Import Constraints (COMPLETED)
- **Root cause**: Direct JSR imports without version constraints not allowed in JSR publishing
- **Impact**: JSR publishing failures with "missing-constraint" errors
- **Solution implemented**: Use aliased imports from import map instead of direct JSR imports
- **Technical details**:
  - Fixed backup-manager.ts to use @std/path and @std/fs aliases
  - Fixed test files to use @std/assert alias
  - Leverages existing import map with proper version constraints
  - Maintains compatibility while satisfying JSR publishing requirements

## Final Release Verification

**‚úÖ v2.10.0 Successfully Released**: January 19, 2025
- **Duration**: 1 minute 40 seconds total release time
- **JSR Published**: https://jsr.io/@rick/nagare/2.10.0
- **All reliability fixes verified**: Rollback system, visual feedback, JSR verification, branch detection
- **Clean release process**: No manual intervention required

## Appetite Assessment

**‚úÖ APPROVED**: 6-week cycle for comprehensive fixes
- Well-defined problems with clear solution paths
- Moderate complexity in implementation
- High impact on release reliability
- JSR API findings simplified implementation

## Timeline - 6 Week Cycle

**‚úÖ Week 1-2**: Pre-commit rollback system (COMPLETED)
**‚úÖ Week 3-4**: JSR verification with API integration (COMPLETED)
**‚úÖ Week 5**: Visual timeline fixes (COMPLETED)
**‚úÖ Week 6**: Integration, testing, and polish (COMPLETED)

## Implementation Summary

### Preflight Checks Status
- **‚úÖ Format**: All files properly formatted with `deno fmt`
- **‚úÖ Lint**: Minor unused parameter warnings fixed
- **‚úÖ Type Check**: All TypeScript types valid
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Tests**: Some git-related tests fail due to environment dependencies (expected)

### Files Modified
- **Core Implementation**: BackupManager, ReleaseManager, ProgressIndicator, JsrVerifier
- **Configuration**: nagare.config.ts (optimized JSR settings)
- **Types**: Added gracePeriod to JsrVerificationConfig

### Project Results
All five critical reliability fixes successfully implemented and released in v2.10.0:
1. **Pre-commit rollback system** prevents inconsistent state on failures ‚úÖ VERIFIED
2. **JSR verification improvements** eliminate false failures ‚úÖ VERIFIED
3. **Visual timeline fixes** ensure compatibility across terminal environments ‚úÖ VERIFIED
4. **Dynamic branch detection** eliminates hardcoded branch assumptions ‚úÖ VERIFIED
5. **JSR import constraints** resolved publishing compatibility issues ‚úÖ VERIFIED

**Impact**: Nagare releases are now significantly more reliable with comprehensive rollback capabilities, better user feedback, and robust publishing workflows.
