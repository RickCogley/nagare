# 🚀 Project Status: Test Coverage & Documentation Site Fix

## 📊 Project Overview

**Project**: Nagare Test Coverage Improvements & Documentation Site Restoration\
**Type**: Technical Debt + Bug Fix\
**Start Date**: 2025-08-13\
**Status**: 🟢 Active\
**Phase**: 🌱 Shaping → Betting → Building → Cool-down

## 🎯 Current Status

### Overall Progress

```
[Shaping] → [**Betting**] → [Building] → [Cool-down]
              ▲
Week 1/6 ████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 16% 🌱
```

### Key Metrics

- **Current Test Coverage**: 36.6% (Target: 80%)
- **Documentation Site**: ❌ Broken (Target: ✅ Functional)
- **Failing Tests**: 16 (Target: 0)
- **Untested Critical Paths**: 5 (Target: 0)

## 📋 Work Streams

### Stream 1: Test Coverage Improvements

**Status**: 🔴 Critical - Needs Immediate Attention\
**Owner**: Development Team\
**Appetite**: 4-6 weeks

#### Problems Identified:

- ❌ 16 failing tests in release-manager
- ❌ Only 36.6% line coverage (critically low)
- ❌ Core release orchestration untested (12.4% coverage)
- ❌ Git operations at 6.9% coverage
- ❌ CLI completely untested

#### Solution Approach:

1. **Phase 1** (Week 1-2): Fix failing tests & critical paths
2. **Phase 2** (Week 3-4): Stability & monitoring coverage
3. **Phase 3** (Week 5-6): Complete coverage & edge cases

### Stream 2: Documentation Site Fix

**Status**: 🟡 Important - Quick Fix Available\
**Owner**: DevOps Team\
**Appetite**: 2-3 days

#### Problem:

- Documentation at https://nagare.esolia.deno.net/ shows broken symbols
- Missing HTML generation in release workflow
- No docs/api directory with generated HTML

#### Solution:

1. **Immediate**: Manual generation & deployment
2. **Automated**: Add doc generation to release workflow
3. **Verification**: Test deployment pipeline

## ✅ Completed This Week

- [x] Comprehensive test coverage gap analysis
- [x] Identified 16 failing tests in release-manager
- [x] Prioritized testing needs by criticality
- [x] Root cause analysis of documentation site issue
- [x] Solution design for automated doc generation

## 🎯 Next Actions

- [ ] Fix 16 failing release-manager tests
- [ ] Implement test suite for GitOperations (HIGH)
- [ ] Add CLI command tests (HIGH)
- [ ] Manual doc generation to restore site
- [ ] Implement automated doc generation in release workflow
- [ ] Create test coverage dashboard

## 🚧 Blockers & Risks

- **Blocker**: Failing tests preventing CI/CD pipeline success
- **Risk**: Low coverage in critical paths could cause production failures
- **Risk**: Documentation site downtime affecting users

## 📊 Resource Allocation

- **Test Coverage**: 175-230 hours total effort estimated
- **Documentation Fix**: 4-8 hours estimated
- **Priority**: Test coverage (critical path first), then docs

## 📝 Notes

- Quality Assurance workflow finally passing after yesterday's fixes
- Test coverage critically low at 36.6% - major risk
- Documentation site has been broken for unknown duration
- Both issues require immediate attention but test coverage is higher risk
