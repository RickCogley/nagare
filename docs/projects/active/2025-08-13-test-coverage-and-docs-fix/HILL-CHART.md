## 🚦 Risk Indicators

### 🔴 High Risk Areas (Uphill)

- **Release Manager Tests**: 16 failures blocking progress
- **Critical Path Coverage**: Only 10% average coverage
- **CLI Testing**: Completely untested

### 🟡 Medium Risk Areas (Approaching Peak)

- **Documentation Fix**: Solution ready, needs execution
- **Monitoring Suite**: Low priority but important

### 🟢 Low Risk Areas (Downhill)

- **Well-tested modules**: Validators, UI (already 90%+)
- **Simple fixes**: Configuration patterns

## 📊 Velocity Metrics

### Current Sprint Velocity

## 📝 Notes & Observations

### Current Observations

- Team motivated after yesterday's QA workflow success
- Documentation fix is straightforward, should be quick win
- Test coverage requires sustained effort over 6 weeks
- Risk of discovering bugs while writing tests

### Adjustments Needed

- May need additional resources for Week 2-3 push
- Consider parallel work streams to accelerate
- Documentation fix should happen immediately (Day 1)
