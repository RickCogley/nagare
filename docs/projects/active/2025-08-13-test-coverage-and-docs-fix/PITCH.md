# 📋 Shape Up Pitch: Test Coverage & Documentation Restoration

## 🎯 Problem

### The Current Situation

Nagare, our release management tool, is facing two critical issues that threaten its reliability and usability:

1. **Dangerously Low Test Coverage (36.6%)**
   - 16 tests currently failing in release-manager
   - Core release orchestration at only 12.4% coverage
   - Git operations at 6.9% coverage
   - CLI completely untested
   - High risk of production failures going undetected

2. **Broken Documentation Site**
   - https://nagare.esolia.deno.net/ shows broken symbol pages
   - Main index page not displaying mod.ts JSDoc content
   - Users cannot access API documentation
   - **Documentation generation is DISABLED in config (line 185)**
   - Was disabled due to backup system conflict (trying to backup generated HTML)

### Why This Matters Now

- **Quality Assurance workflow** just started passing yesterday after significant effort
- **Production risk** is extremely high with such low test coverage
- **User experience** degraded due to broken documentation
- **Technical debt** accumulating rapidly as new features added without tests
- **CI/CD pipeline** vulnerable to regressions

### The Cost of Inaction

- 🔴 **Immediate**: Production bugs slip through untested code paths
- 🔴 **Short-term**: Developer velocity decreases due to fear of breaking things
- 🔴 **Long-term**: Project becomes unmaintainable and loses user trust

## 🍽️ Appetite

### Investment Size

**6-week cycle** broken into two parallel tracks:

#### Track A: Test Coverage (5-6 weeks)

- Week 1-2: Fix failing tests & critical paths
- Week 3-4: Stability & monitoring coverage
- Week 5-6: Complete coverage & edge cases

#### Track B: Documentation Fix (2-3 days)

- Day 1: Manual fix & deployment
- Day 2: Automation implementation
- Day 3: Testing & verification

### Resource Requirements

- **Test Coverage**: 175-230 hours total effort
  - High Priority: 75-95 hours
  - Medium Priority: 70-90 hours
  - Low Priority: 30-45 hours
- **Documentation**: 4-8 hours
- **Team Size**: 2-3 developers

## 💡 Solution

### Core Approach

#### For Test Coverage:

1. **Triage & Fix** (Week 1)
   - Fix 16 failing release-manager tests immediately
   - Establish baseline for improvement

2. **Critical Path Coverage** (Week 2)
   - ReleaseManager: Core orchestration logic
   - GitOperations: Version control operations
   - CLI: User-facing commands

3. **Stability Layer** (Week 3-4)
   - Monitoring suite (auto-fixer, JSR verifier, log parser)
   - Backup/rollback system
   - Event bus system

4. **Completion** (Week 5-6)
   - Configuration module
   - Template processing
   - Edge cases and error scenarios

#### For Documentation:

1. **Immediate Fix**
   ```typescript
   // Edit nagare.config.ts line 185:
   docs: {
     enabled: true,  // ← Change from false to true!
     outputDir: "./docs/api",
     includePrivate: false,
   }
   ```

2. **Fix Backup Conflict**
   - Modify backup system to exclude docs/api directory
   - Or only backup source files, not generated HTML
   - Test that releases work with docs enabled

### Key Design Decisions

#### Testing Strategy:

- **Unit tests first**: Isolate business logic
- **Integration tests second**: Verify component interactions
- **E2E tests last**: Validate complete workflows
- **Mocking approach**: Mock external dependencies (git, GitHub API)
- **Coverage targets**:
  - Critical paths: 95%+
  - Overall: 80%+

#### Documentation Strategy:

- **Automated generation**: Part of every release
- **Hosting**: Continue using Deno Deploy
- **Validation**: Check HTML generation in CI
- **Fallback**: Manual generation if automation fails

### Success Metrics

- ✅ 0 failing tests
- ✅ 80%+ overall test coverage
- ✅ 95%+ coverage on critical paths
- ✅ Documentation site fully functional
- ✅ Automated doc generation working
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline green

## 🐰 Rabbit Holes to Avoid

### Testing Pitfalls:

- ❌ **Over-testing UI components** (already at 100%)
- ❌ **Testing implementation details** instead of behavior
- ❌ **Creating brittle tests** that break with minor changes
- ❌ **Pursuing 100% coverage** on non-critical code
- ❌ **Complex test fixtures** that are hard to maintain

### Documentation Pitfalls:

- ❌ **Over-engineering** the documentation pipeline
- ❌ **Custom documentation generators** instead of using deno doc
- ❌ **Complex deployment pipelines** for simple static files
- ❌ **Trying to fix all documentation issues** in this cycle

## 🚫 No-Gos

These are explicitly out of scope:

- 🚫 Refactoring working code just for testability
- 🚫 Changing the testing framework (stick with Deno test)
- 🚫 Implementing custom documentation themes
- 🚫 Adding new features while improving coverage
- 🚫 Migrating to different documentation hosting
- 🚫 Achieving 100% test coverage everywhere

## 🎨 Sketch of Solution

### Test Coverage Architecture:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Test Coverage Plan          │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ CRITICAL (Week 1-2)                 │
│ ├─ Fix failing tests ──────► 0 failures
│ ├─ ReleaseManager ─────────► 80% coverage
│ ├─ GitOperations ──────────► 80% coverage
│ └─ CLI ────────────────────► 70% coverage
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ STABILITY (Week 3-4)                │
│ ├─ Monitoring Suite ───────► 60% coverage
│ ├─ Backup/Rollback ────────► 70% coverage
│ └─ Event Bus ──────────────► 60% coverage
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ COMPLETION (Week 5-6)               │

└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Documentation Fix Flow:

```
Current State           Quick Fix              Automated Solution
     ❌          →    Manual Generation  →    Release Integration
Broken Site          deno doc --html         generateDocumentation()
                     Commit & Deploy         Auto-run on release
```

## 📊 Risk Assessment

### Risks:

1. **Time underestimation** - Testing might reveal more issues
2. **Dependency conflicts** - Tests might require refactoring
3. **Documentation breaking changes** - Deno doc API might change

### Mitigations:

1. **Phased approach** - Complete critical paths first
2. **Incremental improvements** - Ship working tests frequently
3. **Version pinning** - Lock Deno version for stability
