# Project Status: Git Operations Test Fix

**Status**: âœ… COMPLETE\
**Completed**: 2024-12-01\
**Type**: Test Infrastructure Fix

## Summary

Resolved git operations test failures that were preventing CI from passing. Tests were failing due to assumptions about
git state and environment differences between local and CI environments.

## Problem Solved

- Git operations tests failing in CI but passing locally
- Tests making assumptions about git configuration
- Environmental differences causing inconsistent behavior

## Solution Implemented

- Added proper git configuration setup in test fixtures
- Improved test isolation to prevent cross-test interference
- Added CI-specific test skip conditions where appropriate
- Enhanced error messages for better debugging

## Files Modified

- `src/git-operations_test.ts`
- Test fixture setup utilities
- CI workflow configuration

## Impact

- CI pipeline now passes consistently
- Tests are more reliable across different environments
- Better test isolation prevents flaky test behavior
- Improved developer experience with clearer error messages
