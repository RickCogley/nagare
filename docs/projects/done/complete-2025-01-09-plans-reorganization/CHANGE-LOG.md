# 2025-01-09 Plans Reorganization - Change Log

## Overview

Reorganized repository documentation structure to better align with Aichaku methodology and provide clearer separation
between permanent references and project-specific documentation.

## Changes Made

### Directory Structure Changes

#### Created New Directories

- `/references` - For permanent reference documentation
- `.claude/output/done-*` folders for 8 completed projects
- `.claude/output/active-*` folders for 2 active projects

#### Removed

- `/plans` directory (was empty after reorganization)

### Files Moved to `/references`

Permanent reference documents that serve the entire project:

1. `RESEARCH_TEMPLATE.md`
2. `alternative-commit-conventions.md`
3. `github-security-setup.md`
4. `salty-upgrade-guide.md`
5. `jsr-transform-example.md`
6. `vento-feedback.md`
