## Scopes & Progress

### 1. Application Name Detection ⚫ (At peak - ready to descend)

**Problem solved**: Where to get the application name

- ✅ Found it! Already in `config.project.name`
- ✅ No schema changes needed - it's already there
- ✅ Works for any project using Nagare

### 2. UI Components 🔵 (Climbing - 60% up)

**Still figuring out**: Box drawing implementation details

- ✅ Decided on dependency-free approach
- ✅ Identified terminal compatibility needs
- ⏳ Finalizing responsive width handling
- ⏳ Testing Unicode vs ASCII fallbacks

### 3. Integration Points 🔴 (At base - 20% up)

**Just starting**: Where to inject branded output

- ✅ Mapped all console.log locations
- ⏳ Identifying critical vs nice-to-have points
- ❓ Determining progress indicator granularity

### 4. Testing Strategy 🟡 (Not started)

**To figure out**: How to test terminal output effectively

- ❓ Mock terminal capabilities
- ❓ Snapshot testing approach
- ❓ CI environment simulation

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Use Existing Config**: `config.project.name` already has what we need
2. **Consistent Messaging**: "Nagare: [Action] for [AppName]" throughout
3. **No Schema Changes**: Works with current Nagare configuration
4. **Every Project Covered**: All Nagare users already have project.name set

## Remaining Unknowns

1. **Terminal Width**: How to handle very narrow terminals?
2. **Color Degradation**: Fallback for no-color environments?
3. **Performance Impact**: Measuring overhead of box drawing
4. **I18n Box Drawing**: Right-to-left language support?

## Next Uphill Battles

- [ ] Responsive box sizing algorithm
- [ ] Progress indicator state management
- [ ] Test harness for visual output

## Confidence Level

**Overall**: 75% - Core approach validated, implementation details remain

### By Component:

- Configuration: 95% ⚫
- UI Framework: 70% 🔵
- Integration: 40% 🔴
- Testing: 20% 🟡
