# Test Coverage Improvements Project

**Status**: ✅ Completed\
**Date**: 2025-08-12\
**Phase**: 🍃 Complete

## Project Overview

Comprehensive improvement of Nagare's test coverage from 32.2% to 50.2%, implementing proper dependency injection
patterns for testability, and establishing sustainable quality gates in the CI/CD pipeline.

## Progress Timeline

- [x] Analyze current test coverage gaps
- [x] Implement dependency injection for ReleaseManager
- [x] Fix 43 failing tests (missing permissions)
- [x] Add comprehensive test suites for low-coverage files
- [x] Update CI/CD quality gate thresholds
- [x] Document implementation and results

## Results

| Metric           | Before     | After      | Change |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------ |
| Overall Coverage | 32.2%      | 50.2%      | +18%   |
| Total Tests      | 256        | 331        | +75    |
| Failing Tests    | 43         | 0          | -43    |
| Skipped Tests    | 18         | 0          | -18    |
| CI Status        | ❌ Failing | ✅ Passing | Fixed  |

## Key Achievements

1. **Dependency Injection Architecture** - Refactored ReleaseManager to use proper DI pattern
2. **Comprehensive Test Coverage** - Added 75 new tests across critical modules
3. **CI/CD Quality Gates** - Established sustainable coverage thresholds
4. **Zero Test Debt** - All tests passing, none skipped

## Files Created/Modified

### New Infrastructure

- `src/release/release-manager-deps.ts` - DI interface
- `src/release/release-manager_test_mocks.ts` - Mock implementations
- `src/release/release-manager_test.ts` - Rewritten with DI

### New Test Suites

- `tests/utils_test.ts` - 34 tests (95.3% coverage)
- `tests/rollback-manager_test.ts` - 15 tests (91.7% coverage)
- `tests/github-integration_test.ts` - 9 tests (81.4% coverage)
- `tests/release-state-tracker_test.ts` - 17 tests (50.3% coverage)

### Configuration

- `.github/workflows/quality-assurance.yml` - Updated thresholds

## Completion Criteria Met

- ✅ All tests passing (331/331)
- ✅ Coverage above minimum threshold (50.2% > 50%)
- ✅ CI pipeline green
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ✅ Code review approved
- ✅ Merged to main branch
