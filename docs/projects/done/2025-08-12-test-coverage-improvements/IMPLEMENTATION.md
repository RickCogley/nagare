# Test Coverage Improvements Project

**Date**: 2025-08-12\
**Status**: ✅ Completed\
**Impact**: CI/CD Quality Gates, Test Infrastructure

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive improvement of Nagare's test coverage from 32.2% to 50.2%, implementing proper dependency injection
patterns for testability, and establishing sustainable quality gates in the CI/CD pipeline.

## Problem Statement

The quality-assurance.yml GitHub Actions workflow was failing due to:

- Test coverage below the 35% threshold (actual: 32.2%)
- 43 failing tests due to missing environment permissions
- 18 skipped ReleaseManager tests due to tight coupling with dependencies
- Low coverage in critical files (utils.ts: 1.2%, rollback-manager.ts: 5.8%)

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Dependency Injection Pattern Implementation

Created a proper dependency injection infrastructure for ReleaseManager to enable comprehensive testing:

**Key Files Created**:

- `src/release/release-manager-deps.ts` - Dependency injection interface and factory
- `src/release/release-manager_test_mocks.ts` - Mock implementations of all dependencies
- `src/release/release-manager_test.ts` - Rewritten test file using dependency injection

**Architectural Changes**:

```typescript
// Before: Dependencies created internally
constructor(config: NagareConfig) {
  this.git = new GitOperations(config);
  this.versionUtils = new VersionUtils();
  // ... other dependencies hard-coded
}

// After: Dependencies injected
constructor(config: NagareConfig, deps?: ReleaseManagerDeps) {
  const resolvedDeps = ReleaseManagerDepsFactory.createDeps(this.config, deps);
  this.git = resolvedDeps.git;
  this.versionUtils = resolvedDeps.versionUtils;
  // ... dependencies can be mocked
}
```

### 2. Comprehensive Test Suite Additions

Created new test files for low-coverage modules:

| Module                   | Before Coverage | After Coverage | Tests Added      |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| utils.ts                 | 1.2%            | 95.3%          | 34 tests         |
| rollback-manager.ts      | 5.8%            | 91.7%          | 15 tests         |
| GitHub-integration.ts    | 11.5%           | 81.4%          | 9 tests          |
| release-state-tracker.ts | 9.0%            | 50.3%          | 17 tests         |
| **Overall**              | **32.2%**       | **50.2%**      | **75 new tests** |

### 3. CI/CD Threshold Updates

Updated `.github/workflows/quality-assurance.yml`:

- Test coverage threshold: 35% → 50%
- Type coverage threshold: 30% → 45%

## Implementation Details

### Phase 1: ReleaseManager Refactoring

1. **Created Dependency Injection Interface** (`release-manager-deps.ts`):
   - Defined `ReleaseManagerDeps` interface with all dependencies
   - Created `ReleaseManagerDepsFactory` for dependency resolution
   - Supported partial mocking (only mock what you need)

2. **Built Mock Infrastructure** (`release-manager_test_mocks.ts`):
   - Created mock classes for all 13 dependencies
   - Each mock implements minimal required interface
   - Added file-level lint ignores for test code

3. **Rewrote Test Suite** (`release-manager_test.ts`):
   - All 24 tests now inject mocks properly
   - Tests validate behavior, not implementation
   - Removed reliance on file system and git operations

### Phase 2: Test Coverage Improvements

1. **utils.ts Testing**:
   - Command execution with sanitization
   - Output formatting and colorization
   - Error message formatting
   - Path and string utilities

2. **rollback-manager.ts Testing**:
   - Complete rollback flow testing
   - State verification after rollback
   - Git operation rollback scenarios
   - Error handling during rollback

3. **GitHub-integration.ts Testing**:
   - GitHub release creation flow
   - gh CLI interaction mocking
   - Release notes formatting
   - Error handling and fallbacks

4. **release-state-tracker.ts Testing**:
   - Operation tracking and state management
   - LIFO rollback order verification
   - Diagnostic information generation
   - Rollback with operation dependencies

### Phase 3: CI/CD Fixes

1. **Fixed i18n Test Failures**:
   - Added `--allow-env` permission to test commands
   - Tests now have access to environment variables

2. **Updated Coverage Thresholds**:
   - Raised thresholds to match new coverage levels
   - Ensures future changes maintain quality

## Testing Strategy

### Mock Patterns Used

```typescript
// File system mocking
const originalReadTextFile = Deno.readTextFile;
Deno.readTextFile = async (path: string) => {
  if (path === "version.ts") return mockVersionContent;
  throw new Error("File not found");
};

// Command execution mocking
(Deno as any).Command = class MockCommand {
  output = async () => ({
    success: true,
    code: 0,
    stdout: new TextEncoder().encode("mocked output"),
    stderr: new Uint8Array(),
  });
};
```

### Test Organization

- **Unit Tests**: Isolated component testing with full mocking
- **Integration Tests**: Component interaction testing
- **Security Tests**: OWASP compliance verification
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark critical operations

## Security Considerations

All new tests include security-focused scenarios:

- Input sanitization verification
- Command injection prevention
- Path traversal protection
- Template sandboxing validation

## Metrics and Results

### Before

- 256 total tests, 43 failing, 18 skipped
- 32.2% test coverage
- CI pipeline failing on coverage threshold

### After

- 331 total tests, 0 failing, 0 skipped
- 50.2% test coverage (+18 percentage points)
- CI pipeline passing all quality gates

### Performance Impact

- Test execution time: ~3 seconds (acceptable)
- No impact on production code performance
- Improved maintainability through better testability

## Lessons Learned

1. **Dependency Injection is Critical**: The original tight coupling made testing nearly impossible. The refactoring to
   use DI was essential for achieving proper test coverage.

2. **Mock at the Right Level**: Mocking Deno APIs directly (like `Deno.Command`) is more reliable than trying to mock at
   higher levels.

3. **Test Data Management**: The version.ts file being overwritten during tests highlighted the need for careful test
   data isolation.

4. **Incremental Improvements Work**: Rather than trying to reach 80% coverage immediately, setting realistic
   incremental goals (50% first) was more achievable.

## Future Recommendations

1. **Continue Coverage Improvements**: Target 80% coverage as the next milestone
2. **Add E2E Tests**: Create full end-to-end release scenarios
3. **Performance Benchmarks**: Add performance regression tests
4. **Security Scanning**: Integrate security-focused test tools
5. **Test Documentation**: Improve test documentation and examples

## Files Modified

### Core Changes

- `src/release/release-manager.ts` - Added dependency injection support
- `src/release/release-manager-deps.ts` - New dependency injection interface
- `src/release/release-manager_test_mocks.ts` - New mock implementations
- `src/release/release-manager_test.ts` - Complete rewrite with DI

### New Test Files

- `tests/utils_test.ts` - 34 new tests
- `tests/rollback-manager_test.ts` - 15 new tests
- `tests/github-integration_test.ts` - 9 new tests
- `tests/release-state-tracker_test.ts` - 17 new tests

### CI Configuration

- `.github/workflows/quality-assurance.yml` - Updated thresholds

## Coverage HTML Generation

To generate HTML coverage reports in Deno:

```bash
# Step 1: Run tests with coverage collection
deno test --allow-all --coverage=coverage

# Step 2: Generate HTML report from coverage data
deno coverage --html coverage

# The HTML report is generated in coverage/html/index.html
# Open it in a browser to see detailed line-by-line coverage
open coverage/html/index.html
```

The HTML report provides:

- File-by-file coverage percentages
- Line-by-line coverage highlighting
- Uncovered code sections in red
- Summary statistics and trends
- Drilldown into specific files

### Coverage Report Features

- **Green lines**: Covered by tests
- **Red lines**: Not covered by tests
- **Yellow lines**: Partially covered (branches)
- **Gray lines**: Not executable (comments, imports)

## Commands Reference

```bash
# Run all tests
deno test --allow-all

# Run with coverage
deno test --allow-all --coverage=coverage

# Generate coverage report (LCOV format)
deno coverage coverage --lcov > coverage.lcov

# Generate HTML coverage report
deno coverage --html coverage

# Generate detailed coverage report
deno coverage coverage --detailed

# Run specific test file
deno test tests/utils_test.ts

# Run tests in watch mode
deno test --watch

# Run tests with specific permissions
deno test --allow-read --allow-write --allow-env --allow-run
```

## Conclusion

This project successfully improved Nagare's test coverage from 32.2% to 50.2% through systematic refactoring and
comprehensive test additions. The implementation of dependency injection has made the codebase significantly more
testable and maintainable. The updated CI/CD thresholds ensure this improved quality level is maintained going forward.

The foundation is now in place for continuing to improve coverage toward the industry-standard 80% target while
maintaining code quality and security standards.
