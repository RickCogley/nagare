# Workflow Dispatch Implementation - Completion Report

## Summary

Successfully added `workflow_dispatch` trigger to all GitHub workflows, enabling manual execution via GitHub CLI and UI.

## Changes Made

### Workflow Files Updated

1. **`.github/workflows/codeql.yml`** - Added workflow_dispatch trigger
2. **`.github/workflows/dependency-review.yml`** - Converted single-line trigger to multi-line format and added
   workflow_dispatch
3. **`.github/workflows/devskim.yml`** - Added workflow_dispatch trigger
4. **`.github/workflows/security.yml`** - Added workflow_dispatch trigger

Note: `.github/workflows/publish.yml` already had workflow_dispatch enabled.

## Benefits Achieved

✅ All workflows can now be triggered manually ✅ Developers can run security scans on-demand ✅ Easier debugging of
workflow issues ✅ No breaking changes - existing triggers preserved

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Run DevSkim security scan manually
gh workflow run "DevSkim Security Scan" --ref main

# Run CodeQL analysis
gh workflow run "CodeQL" --ref main

# Run dependency review
gh workflow run "Dependency Review" --ref main

# Run security tests
gh workflow run "Security Tests" --ref main
```

## Next Steps

The changes are ready to be committed and pushed. Once pushed, all workflows will support manual triggering.
