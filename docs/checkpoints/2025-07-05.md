# Session Summary - July 5, 2025

## Main Accomplishments

1. **Consolidated Global Memory Configuration**
   - Moved security scanning documentation from incorrect location (`~/.config/claude/memory/`) to
     proper global memory file (`~/.claude/config.md`)
   - Added comprehensive DevSkim and CodeQL configuration sections to global memory
   - Cleaned up incorrectly placed files

2. **Created Custom Slash Commands**
   - Added 7 custom slash commands to `~/.claude/settings.json` for quick access to documentation
   - Created `/session-save` command for deterministic session saving to
     `.claude/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
   - Commands include: `/global-memory`, `/project-memory`, `/security-rules`, `/preflight`,
     `/owasp`, `/commit-style`, `/directory-structure`

3. **Organized Session Summaries**
   - Moved existing session summaries from project root to `.claude/sessions/`
   - Established consistent naming convention (YYYY-MM-DD.md)
   - Decided to keep sessions in git (not gitignored) for project history

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **File Organization**
   - Claude Code global files: `~/.claude/` (not `~/.config/claude/`)
   - Session summaries: `.claude/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD.md` in each project
   - Global memory: `~/.claude/config.md`
   - Settings: `~/.claude/settings.json`

2. **Slash Command Design**
   - Created deterministic `/session-save` command with explicit save location
   - Acknowledged slash commands don't support parameters/subcommands
   - Made prompts very specific to ensure consistent behavior

3. **Security Scanning Best Practices** (added to global memory)
   - DevSkim: Inline suppressions at END of line
   - CodeQL: Suppressions on SEPARATE line before code
   - Directory exclusions via workflow configuration for auto-generated files

## Files Created/Modified

### Created

- `/Users/rcogley/dev/nagare/.claude/sessions/2025-07-04.md` - Moved session summary
- `/Users/rcogley/dev/nagare/.claude/sessions/2025-07-05.md` - Current session summary

### Modified

- `/Users/rcogley/.claude/config.md` - Added security scanning configuration sections
- `/Users/rcogley/.claude/settings.json` - Added 8 custom slash commands
- `/Users/rcogley/dev/nagare/.gitignore` - Temporarily added then reverted `.claude/` exclusion

### Deleted

- `/Users/rcogley/.config/claude/memory/` directory and contents (wrong location)

## Problems Solved

1. **Session Summary Organization**: Established consistent location and naming for session files
2. **Global Memory Location**: Corrected file paths and consolidated documentation
3. **Quick Access**: Created slash commands for frequently needed documentation
4. **Deterministic Saves**: Created `/session-save` command that always saves to the correct
   location

## Lessons Learned

1. **Claude Code File Structure**: Global configuration lives in `~/.claude/`, not
   `~/.config/claude/`
2. **Slash Command Limitations**: No parameter support, but specific prompts can achieve
   deterministic behavior
3. **Built-in vs Custom Commands**: `/save` is built-in and can't be configured, but custom commands
   can be more specific
4. **Documentation Value**: Keeping session summaries in git provides valuable project history
5. **Prompt Engineering**: Very specific prompts in slash commands ensure consistent behavior across
   sessions
