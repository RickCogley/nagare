# Nagare Development Session Summary - July 4, 2025

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Completed i18n Implementation

- Added full internationalization support for CLI output
- Created comprehensive Japanese and English translations
- Implemented i18n for logger messages, init command, confirmation prompts, and progress indicators
- Released as part of v2.2.0

### 2. Resolved All Code Scanning Security Alerts

- Fixed 14+ security alerts from DevSkim and CodeQL
- Key learnings:
  - DevSkim: Comments must be inline at END of line (`code // DevSkim: ignore DS######`)
  - CodeQL: Comments must be on SEPARATE line before (`// codeql[rule-id]`)
- Configured DevSkim to exclude `/docs` directory via workflow `ignore-globs`
- Added comprehensive security scanning documentation to CLAUDE.md
- Created global memory files for future efficiency:
  - `security-scanning-best-practices.md`
  - `github-security-alerts-workflow.md`

### 3. Released Nagare v2.2.1

- Included all security fixes and i18n support
- Successfully published to JSR
- Clean release with no remaining security alerts

### 4. Updated Salty Configuration

- Upgraded salty to use nagare 2.2.1
- Simplified configuration using built-in file handlers
- Added SECURITY_COMPLIANCE tracking to version.ts
- Removed custom README updateFn in favor of built-in handler
- Successfully tested and deployed

## Key Technical Decisions

### Security Suppressions

- Test SHA values: Use DevSkim DS162092 or DS173237
- Intentional regex patterns: Use DevSkim DS137138 and CodeQL js/regex/missing-regexp-anchor
- ReDoS test patterns: Use DevSkim DS137138 and CodeQL js/redos
- TODO comments: Use DevSkim DS176209
- SSL/TLS documentation: Use DevSkim DS440000/DS440011

### Configuration Improvements

- Built-in handlers now smart enough for most use cases
- Keep custom handlers only when necessary (e.g., salty's deno.json with "version" task)
- Standard badge formats work with built-in Markdown handler

## Files Created/Modified

### Nagare Repository

- Added security scanning configuration section to CLAUDE.md
- Fixed suppression comments in multiple test and source files
- Updated DevSkim workflow configuration
- Created session memory files for Claude Code

### Salty Repository

- Updated nagare.config.ts with security compliance tracking
- Simplified file update configuration
- Updated to nagare 2.2.1
- Released salty v2.2.7 with new configuration

## Lessons Learned

1. **Tool-Specific Syntax**: Different security scanners have very specific requirements for suppression comment
   placement
2. **Built-in Handlers**: Nagare's built-in file handlers can handle most standard cases, reducing configuration
   complexity
3. **Documentation**: Proper documentation of security decisions and suppression rationales is crucial
4. **Workflow Configuration**: Sometimes it's better to exclude directories at the workflow level rather than adding
   many inline suppressions

## Next Steps (Future Considerations)

1. Monitor for any new security alerts as code evolves
2. Consider adding more built-in file handlers for other common formats
3. Potential enhancement: Add security compliance reports to release notes
4. Document any additional patterns that emerge from salty usage

## Session Stats

- Duration: ~5 hours
- Releases: 2 (Nagare 2.2.0, 2.2.1)
- Security alerts resolved: 14+
- Configuration lines eliminated: ~40+ in salty

Great collaborative session with significant improvements to both security posture and developer experience!
