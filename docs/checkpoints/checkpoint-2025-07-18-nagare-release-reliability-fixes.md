# Session Checkpoint - 2025-07-18 - Nagare Release Reliability Fixes

## Summary of Work Accomplished
- **Implemented three critical reliability fixes** for the nagare release process using a "skeptical senior engineer" approach
- **Phase 1**: Created pre-commit rollback system with BackupManager to prevent inconsistent repository state on failures
- **Phase 2**: Fixed JSR verification false failures by switching to official REST API with grace periods
- **Phase 3**: Resolved visual timeline rendering issues with terminal compatibility and graceful degradation
- **Integration**: Conducted comprehensive testing, preflight checks, and organized commit with detailed documentation

## Key Technical Decisions

### BackupManager Architecture
- **UUID-based backup tracking** for collision-free concurrent operations
- **Atomic file operations** with comprehensive error handling and automatic cleanup
- **Security validation** using existing validateFilePath utilities
- **Custom UUID generation** to avoid std/uuid dependency issues

### JSR Verification Strategy
- **API-first approach** using `GET https://jsr.io/api/scopes/{scope}/packages/{name}` instead of HEAD requests
- **Grace period implementation** (45 seconds) to allow JSR processing after GitHub Actions complete
- **Dual verification** checking both `latestVersion` and `/versions` endpoint for comprehensive coverage
- **Enhanced debugging** with detailed error messages and timing information

### Visual Timeline Compatibility
- **TTY detection** using `Deno.stdout.isTerminal()` for environment awareness
- **ANSI capability checking** with environment variable validation (TERM, NO_COLOR, CI)
- **Graceful degradation** from detailed → minimal → simple append-only output
- **Auto-fallback mechanism** with debug mode support (NAGARE_DEBUG=true)

## Files Created/Modified

### Created

- `docs/projects/active/2025-07-18-nagare-release-reliability-fixes/pitch.md` - Shape Up methodology pitch
- `docs/projects/active/2025-07-18-nagare-release-reliability-fixes/jsr_authentication_guide.md` - JSR API usage guide
- `docs/projects/active/2025-07-18-nagare-release-reliability-fixes/jsr_version_check_guide.md` - JSR verification guide

### Modified
- `src/release-manager.ts` - Integrated BackupManager with pre-commit rollback system
- `src/jsr-verifier.ts` - Complete rewrite using JSR REST API with grace periods
- `src/progress-indicator.ts` - Added TTY detection and terminal compatibility
- `types.ts` - Added gracePeriod to JsrVerificationConfig interface
- `nagare.config.ts` - Optimized JSR verification settings with reduced timeouts
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated with aichaku configuration and project context

## Problems Solved

### 1. Rollback Problem (Repository State Corruption)
- **Issue**: Failed releases left modified files (version.ts, CHANGELOG.md) requiring manual cleanup
- **Root Cause**: Files modified before validation, no pre-commit cleanup mechanism
- **Solution**: BackupManager creates UUID-tracked backups before file modification, with automatic restoration on failures
- **Impact**: Prevents repository from being left in inconsistent state during release failures

### 2. JSR Verification False Failures
- **Issue**: Successful JSR publishes marked as failed due to timing/race conditions
- **Root Cause**: HEAD requests and timing issues between GitHub Actions completion and JSR availability
- **Solution**: Switch to official JSR REST API with grace periods and proper version checking
- **Impact**: Eliminates false failures and provides more reliable JSR publication verification

### 3. Visual Timeline Rendering Broken
- **Issue**: Progress indicators displaying incorrectly, especially in CI/CD environments
- **Root Cause**: ANSI escape sequences not supported in non-TTY environments
- **Solution**: Terminal compatibility detection with graceful degradation to simple append-only output
- **Impact**: Progress indicators work correctly across all terminal environments

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights
- **JSR API is very fast** - `GET https://jsr.io/api/scopes/rick/packages/nagare` responds immediately
- **TTY detection is crucial** - Many CI/CD environments don't support ANSI escape sequences
- **Backup strategies need atomic operations** - UUID-based tracking prevents race conditions
- **Error handling cascades** - Comprehensive error handling at each level prevents failure propagation

### Development Approach
- **"Skeptical senior engineer" methodology** - Going "carefully step by step and confirming and re-confirming" prevented multiple release cycles
- **Phase-based implementation** - Breaking complex fixes into phases allowed thorough testing
- **Comprehensive documentation** - Shape Up methodology with detailed pitch and status tracking
- **API-first verification** - Using official APIs instead of heuristics provides more reliable results

### Code Quality Patterns
- **Prefer official APIs** over heuristic approaches (JSR REST API vs HEAD requests)
- **Environment detection** is essential for cross-platform compatibility
- **Atomic operations** with proper cleanup prevent inconsistent states
- **Graceful degradation** ensures functionality across different environments

## Next Steps

### Immediate Opportunities
- **Monitor JSR API performance** - Track response times and adjust grace periods if needed
- **Expand terminal compatibility** - Test with additional terminal emulators and CI/CD systems
- **Enhance backup strategies** - Consider compression for large documentation directories
- **Performance optimization** - Profile backup/restore operations for large repositories

### Future Enhancements
- **Backup retention policies** - Implement automatic cleanup of old backups
- **Progress indicator customization** - Allow users to configure progress styles
- **JSR verification caching** - Cache recent verification results to reduce API calls
- **Integration testing** - Automated tests for the complete release pipeline

### Technical Debt
- **Test environment dependencies** - Some git-related tests fail due to environment setup
- **Error message localization** - Consider i18n for error messages in different languages
- **Configuration validation** - Add schema validation for nagare.config.ts
- **Monitoring integration** - Add metrics for backup/restore operations
