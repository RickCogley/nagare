# Session Checkpoint - 2025-07-09

## Summary of Work Accomplished

### 1. Critical Release Process Fix

- **Problem Solved**: Every nagare release was failing due to formatting/linting errors discovered
  AFTER git tags were created
- **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive pre-flight validation that runs all checks BEFORE creating
  tags
- **Impact**: Eliminated painful manual recovery process and ensures clean releases

### 2. Version Jump Bug Resolution

- **Problem Solved**: Version numbers were jumping erratically (e.g., v2.7.0 â†’ v5.2.0) on failed
  releases
- **Solution**: Modified version detection to use immutable git tags as source of truth instead of
  mutable version.ts file
- **Impact**: Ensures consistent versioning even when releases fail

### 3. Language Configuration Enhancement

- **Problem Solved**: Nagare forced Japanese language based on system locale
- **Solution**: Added configurable language support via --lang flag and NAGARE_LANG env var
- **Impact**: Defaults to English regardless of system locale, improving international usability

### 4. AI Integration Improvement

- **Problem Solved**: Invalid --extended-thinking flag in nagare.config.ts
- **Solution**: Discovered and implemented Claude Code's thinking keywords
  (think/megathink/ultrathink)
- **Impact**: Enables configurable AI analysis depth based on user's subscription plan

### 5. GitHub Workflow Enhancement

- **Problem Solved**: Workflows could only be triggered by configured events
- **Solution**: Added workflow_dispatch to all GitHub workflows
- **Impact**: Enables manual security scans and workflow testing via gh CLI

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Pre-flight Validation Architecture**
   - Decision: Run validation BEFORE any git operations
   - Rationale: Prevents creation of immutable artifacts (tags) when code isn't ready
   - Implementation: Added performPreflightChecks() method that runs format, lint, and type checks

2. **Version Source Hierarchy**
   - Decision: Read version from git tags first, fall back to version.ts only for initial release
   - Rationale: Git tags are immutable and represent the true release history
   - Implementation: Modified getCurrentVersion() in version-utils.ts

3. **AI Thinking Levels**
   - Decision: Use prompt engineering with keywords instead of CLI flags
   - Rationale: Claude Code responds to specific keywords in prompts, not CLI arguments
   - Implementation: Added thinkingLevel configuration option with three levels

## Files Created/Modified

### Created

- `.claude/output/complete-2025-07-08-workflow-dispatch/` - Project documentation
- `.claude/sessions/2025-07-09.md` - This checkpoint file
- Various test files for new functionality

### Modified

- `src/release-manager.ts` - Added pre-flight validation system
- `src/version-utils.ts` - Fixed version detection logic
- `src/auto-fixer.ts` - Enhanced AI prompt generation
- `types.ts` - Added new interfaces for pre-flight checks
- `.github/workflows/*.yml` - Added workflow_dispatch triggers
- `README.md` - Updated documentation
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Documented changes
- `nagare.config.ts` - Updated AI configuration

## Problems Solved

1. **Release Failures**: Solved systematic release failures by validating before tagging
2. **Version Inconsistency**: Fixed version jumps by using proper source of truth
3. **Language Barriers**: Made tool accessible to non-Japanese users
4. **AI Integration Confusion**: Clarified how to properly use Claude Code's extended analysis
5. **Workflow Limitations**: Enabled on-demand workflow execution

## Lessons Learned

1. **Validate Early**: Always validate before creating immutable artifacts
2. **Source of Truth**: Use immutable sources (git tags) over mutable files for critical data
3. **Prompt Engineering**: AI tools often respond to keywords in prompts rather than CLI flags
4. **User Flexibility**: Providing manual triggers for automated processes improves developer
   experience
5. **Internationalization**: Never assume user's language preference from system locale

## Next Steps

- Monitor the effectiveness of the new release process in production
- Consider adding more comprehensive CI environment detection
- Potential improvements to error recovery workflows
- Document the new features in user guides
