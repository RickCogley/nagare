# Session Checkpoint - 2025-07-09

## Context

Continuing from a previous session about nagare's JSR publication verification and critical release
process improvements.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed Critical Release Process Issue

**Problem**: Every nagare release was failing because formatting/linting errors were discovered
AFTER tags were created, requiring painful manual recovery.

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive pre-flight validation system that:

- Runs all checks (format, lint, type check) BEFORE creating git tags
- Auto-formats files after updates
- Attempts automatic fixes for failures
- Prevents tag creation if validation fails

**Status**: ✅ Completed and released in v2.8.0

### 2. Fixed Version Jump Bug

**Problem**: Version numbers were jumping (e.g., v2.7.0 to v5.2.0) when releases failed because
nagare read from the mutable version.ts file.

**Solution**: Modified `getCurrentVersion()` to:

- Read from immutable git tags as primary source
- Fall back to version.ts only for initial releases
- Ensures version consistency even with failed attempts

**Status**: ✅ Completed and released in v2.8.1

### 3. Language Configuration

**Problem**: Nagare forced Japanese language based on system locale.

**Solution**: Made language configurable via:

- `--lang` CLI flag
- `NAGARE_LANG` environment variable
- Defaults to English regardless of system locale

**Status**: ✅ Completed

### 4. AI Integration Enhancement

**Problem**: Invalid `--extended-thinking` flag in nagare.config.ts

**Solution**:

- Discovered Claude Code uses "think", "megathink", "ultrathink" keywords
- Implemented configurable thinking levels for different subscription plans
- Updated prompts to use thinking keywords effectively

**Status**: ✅ Completed

### 5. Workflow Dispatch Implementation

**Problem**: GitHub workflows could only be triggered by their configured events.

**Solution**: Added `workflow_dispatch` to all workflows enabling manual execution via:

```bash
gh workflow run "workflow-name" --ref main
```

**Status**: ✅ Completed and tested

## Current State

### Git Status

- Branch: main
- Working tree: clean
- All changes committed and pushed

### Todo List Status

All major tasks completed:

- ✅ Shape Up pitch for release process
- ✅ Pre-tag validation implementation
- ✅ Automatic formatting
- ✅ Tag rollback and retry mechanism
- ✅ Testing new release process
- ✅ Documentation updates
- ✅ Final reports created
- ✅ Released v2.8.1 successfully
- ✅ Workflow dispatch implementation

One deferred task:

- ⏸️ CI environment validation (low priority)

### Active Projects

All projects have been completed and moved to done folders:

- `complete-2025-07-08-workflow-dispatch/`
- Previous release process fixes properly documented

## Key Learnings

1. **Pre-flight Validation Pattern**: Always validate BEFORE creating immutable artifacts (tags)
2. **Version Source of Truth**: Use git tags, not mutable files, for version detection
3. **Claude Code Thinking**: Use prompt keywords, not CLI flags, for extended analysis
4. **JSR Yanking**: The JSR web UI has a "yank" feature for removing problematic versions

## Next Potential Tasks

- Monitor the effectiveness of the new release process
- Consider adding more comprehensive CI environment detection
- Potential improvements to error recovery workflows

## Files Modified in This Session

- `.github/workflows/` - Added workflow_dispatch to all workflows
- Multiple test files and source files for release process improvements
- Documentation updates in README.md and CHANGELOG.md
