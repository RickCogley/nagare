# ðŸŽ¯ Quick Reference for Claude Code

## Before ANY work:
1. Check docs/projects/active/ for existing project directories
2. Create new YYYY-MM-DD-{name} directory for new work
3. If user says methodology terms (sprint, shape, kanban), enter DISCUSSION mode
4. Wait for explicit "create project" signal before making files

## File Organization:
- ALWAYS create in docs/projects/active/YYYY-MM-DD-{name}/
- NEVER create in .claude/user/ (that's for user customizations only)  
- NEVER create in project root (keep it clean)

## Methodology Detection:
- User says "plan sprint" â†’ Create active-YYYY-MM-DD-sprint-planning/
- User says "fix bug" â†’ Create active-YYYY-MM-DD-fix-[bug-description]/
